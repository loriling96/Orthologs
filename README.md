# Orthologs
This repo documents my attempts to find orthologs of Aiptasia gene models in other cnidarians. 
The scripts here helped me practice command line BLAST, shell scripting, and connecting to computing clusters. 
OrthoFinder is well-written software that does all this way more elegantly https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder
